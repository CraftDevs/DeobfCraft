DeObfuscating-Loader
====================  
 
Will load a Obfuscated Minecraft jar and at run time using MCP mappings deobfuscate it. It will then cache that deobfuscated copy. Then load a program that uses Minecraft as a dependency.

This program will allow you to make edits to the minecraft src using a special patch like system I have made.
Also you have the ability to use an Access Transformer to change method and variable accesses levels.

This code I hope will help CXGamer with his Redstone Simulator that loads MCP mappings.
