DeObfuscating-Loader
====================

Will load a Obfuscated Minecraft jar and at run time using MCP mappings deobfuscate it then load a program that uses Minecraft as a dependency.

This project will use code for ForgeModLoader and also code for the Sponge server Forge implementation code.

The Forge code will be used to help me understand deobfing at runtime and the Sponge code will be used (basicly all the @shadow code) to allow for devs to a hooks into the minecraft src.
